# EC-Benchmark-2-CSE370
This repository contains the work done on the EC (environmental contour) benchmark 2 announced at OMAE 2021. Specifically, this work concerns exercise 1, which is involved in predicting exceedance probabilities and return values of extreme ocean waves from a 25 year data set. The included code is a modification of the code provided in the original benchmark, and compares the results of different modeling approaches and extreme value distributions. The files provided in this repository are created by Jennings Ye with the help of [Taemin Heo](http://taeminheo.com) and [Dr. Lance Manuel](https://lancemanuel.netlify.app/) at The University of Texas at Austin.
